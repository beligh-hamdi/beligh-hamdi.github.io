<p>&nbsp;Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 are here, and you know what that means. New baselines and new possibilities! Spring Framework implies a Java 17 and Jakarta EE baseline and offers new support for building GraalVM-native images and a compile-time component model in the new Spring AOT engine. It also offers a new observability layer, declarative HTTP and RSocket clients, preliminary Project Loom and CRaC support, Problem-Details support, and so much more. Join me, Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman), and we'll look at next-gen Spring.</p>
